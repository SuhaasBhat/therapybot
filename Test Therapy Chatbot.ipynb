So, I'd like to share some information with you. The reason for your visit today was to talk about some medications that can help you curb the withdrawal symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal. They're not necessarily the same thing as the Narcan but they can be helpful in helping you relax, increase your mood, feel better about yourself and maybe even give you some ideas about how to take care of stress and-to do some different approaches to cope with stress in different ways. How were you able to respond to get to start using alcohol? What were some of these medications? Where did you take them? Which one? Could you tell me some recommendations for some suggestions for where to try? "
